# About

This project is a custom inventory management system designed for a small shop. It includes:

- **Frontend**: Built using Next.js
- **Backend**: Built using Node.js and Express

### Branching Structure

- **Feature Branches**: Each feature is developed in a separate branch:
  - Frontend features are in branches named `frontend/feature/featurename`.
  - Backend features are in branches named `backend/feature/featurename`.
  
- **Main Branch**: The `main` branch contains the final, stable code.

- **Development Flow**:
  - All feature branches are rebased from the `develop` branch.
  - All pull requests (PRs) are made to the `develop` branch.

### Notes

- The `docs` folder is not relevant for the project and can be ignored.
- Both the backend and frontend contain detailed `README.md` files explaining the project structure and how to run the application.
- The entire project is written in TypeScript.


# Deployment Guide

## Overview
The deployment is managed using GitHub Actions.

### Backend Deployment

- The backend is deployed on Render through GitHub Actions.
- To see how the deployment works, navigate to the **GitHub Actions workflows** in the repository.
- The `server.yml` workflow is responsible for deploying the backend code to Render.

### Deployment Considerations

1. **Do not add `NODE_ENV` when deploying on Render**  
   Adding `NODE_ENV` may cause issues with `tsc` (TypeScript Compiler), as noted in this [Render community post](https://community.render.com/t/tsc-not-found-during-build/6428).

2. **Setting up GitHub Actions for Render Deployment**  
   For a complete guide on how to set up GitHub Actions for deployment to Render, check out this official Render documentation:
