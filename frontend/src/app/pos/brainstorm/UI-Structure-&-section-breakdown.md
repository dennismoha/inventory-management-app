# **POS System UI Structure & Section Breakdown Template**

## **1. Navbar**
### **Purpose:**
The navbar provides a consistent, accessible header for the application. It holds primary navigation options and other global actions such as settings or user information.

### **Content:**
- **Logo**: Positioned on the left side (clickable to return to the homepage/dashboard).

  - Profile image and user name (with a dropdown for settings and logout options).
- **Action Buttons**:
  - **Search Bar**: A search input to quickly find products or categories.
  - **Notification Icon**: Alerts for important actions like low stock or pending actions.

### **Behavior**:
- The navbar should be **fixed at the top** of the page.
- Links should have clear hover effects for better accessibility.
- The navbar should be responsive to adapt for smaller screens (e.g., mobile, tablet).
- **Search functionality** should be dynamic and return results as users type.

## **2. Filter Section (Left Side - Above Product/Category Display)**
### **Purpose:**
The filter section allows users to narrow down the product list or categories based on specific criteria. It serves as a quick navigation area for users to find items of interest based on common attributes.

### **Content:**
- **Product Filter Buttons**:
  - **Show All Products**: Default view, shows the entire product catalog.
  - **Show Categories**: Button to display only product categories.
  - **Show Subcategories**: Option to filter products by subcategories within a selected category.
  - **Stock Status Filters**: Filter to show products based on stock availability (e.g., in-stock, out-of-stock).
  - **Price Range Filter**: A slider or input to set a minimum and maximum price for filtering.
  - **Search by Product Name or SKU**: Text input to allow searching for products directly by name or SKU.
  - **Brand/Manufacturer Filter**: If applicable, filter by product brand or supplier.
- **Sort Options**:
  - **Sort by Price**: Ascending/Descending.
  - **Sort by Name**: Alphabetically A-Z, Z-A.
  - **Sort by Date Added**: Newest or oldest first.

### **Behavior**:
- Filters should be collapsible to maintain a clean UI, expanding only when needed.
- Filter options should be **checkboxes**, **dropdowns**, or **sliders** for intuitive user interaction.
- The selected filters should highlight or be shown as active to indicate what’s being applied.
- The **filter section** should be able to reset to “default” if needed (e.g., “Show All Products”).
- For **responsive design**, this section may move to a horizontal format or a hamburger-style menu on smaller screens.

## **3. Left-Side Menu (Vertical Navigation Menu)**
### **Purpose:**
The left-side menu provides access to other major sections of the POS system. It is designed for ease of navigation between various views or administrative tools, such as product management, order history, etc.

### **Content:**

  - **Suppliers**: Manage supplier information and link products.
  - **Orders**: View and manage past orders and transactions.

  - **Settings**: Manage application settings (e.g., user preferences, POS configuration).
  - **User Profile**: Option to view and edit user profile (if applicable).

### **Behavior**:
- The menu should be **collapsible** to free up space in the main content area, especially on smaller screens.
- The menu should highlight the **active section** to show users where they currently are within the system.
- Use **icons** next to each menu item for intuitive navigation.
- Menu items should be clearly clickable with visual feedback (e.g., hover effects or active state indicators).
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: The menu may switch to a sliding or hamburger-style menu on smaller screens.

## **4. Main Display Area (Middle Section - Products/Content Display)**
### **Purpose:**
The central display area is where all product information, categories, and related content are shown. It dynamically adjusts based on the user’s interaction with the filter section and menu.

### **Content**:
- **Product Grid**:
  - **Product Cards**: Each product card includes:
    - Product Image (150px x 150px).
    - Product Name.
    - Price.
    - Stock Status.
    - Option to **Add to Cart**.
    - Option to **View Details** (for detailed product page).
- **Category/Filter View**:
  - When users select a category or subcategory, this area should display the corresponding products from that category.
- **Pagination or Infinite Scroll**:
  - For large product sets, implement **pagination** or **infinite scroll** for smooth browsing.
- **Search Results**:
  - Show results dynamically when users search for a product, displaying the matching results in the grid.
- **Loading Indicators**:
  - Use a **spinner** or **skeleton loader** while content is being fetched from the server or when filtering is applied.
  
### **Behavior**:
- The product grid should **respond to filter changes**, dynamically updating the displayed products without reloading the page (AJAX or similar).
- Each product card should have **hover effects** to indicate interactivity (e.g., change in opacity, background, etc.).
- The grid should be **responsive** to adjust the number of columns based on screen size (3 columns for desktop, 2 for tablet, 1 for mobile).
- **Empty state message**: If no products match the filter or search, display a user-friendly message (e.g., "No products found").

## **5. Checkout Area (Right Side)**
### **Purpose:**
The checkout area displays the cart details, allowing the user to review their selected products and proceed with the purchase. This section should be user-friendly and easy to navigate, providing all necessary details for checkout.

### **Content**:
- **Cart Summary**:
  - List of all items added to the cart, including:
    - Product Name.
    - Quantity (editable).
    - Unit Price.
    - Total Price per product.
    - Remove item button.
  - **Cart Total**: Shows the subtotal of all products in the cart.

- **Checkout Button**:
  - **Proceed to Checkout**: Button to finalize the transaction.
  - If the user is not logged in or has incomplete information, display prompts for login or missing details.
- **Payment Options**:
  - Display buttons for various payment options (e.g., Credit Card, Cash, Online Payment).
- **Clear Cart Option**:
  - Button to empty the cart, with a confirmation prompt.
  
### **Behavior**:
- The checkout section should dynamically update when items are added/removed or when quantities are changed.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the checkout section is scrollable and adapts to smaller screen sizes, either reducing its width or shifting the layout (e.g., stacked cards).
- If the cart is empty, display a message like "Your cart is empty!" to encourage shopping.

---

### **Responsive Design Notes**:
- On smaller screens (tablets and mobiles), **hide or collapse** less critical sections like the left-side menu or filter buttons.
- For mobile, consider making the checkout area **sticky** so it remains visible as users scroll through the products.
- Ensure that all interactions (filtering, cart updates, and checkout) are **fast and intuitive** on all devices.
