### **Legend**:
- **✓**: Feature implemented and verified.
- **✗**: Feature not implemented or requires further attention.
- **Pending**: Feature under development or not yet started.

---

### **Notes for Traceability**:
1. **Status Updates**: As the development progresses, this matrix should be updated to reflect the **current status** of each feature. Developers should mark each feature with the relevant status (✓/✗/Pending) based on their completion.
2. **Comments/Notes**: Use the "Comments/Notes" column to document any specific issues, customizations, or additional clarifications related to a feature. This could include user interface design decisions, dependencies on backend services, or future improvements.
3. **Testing and Validation**: Ensure that each feature listed in this matrix is validated during QA testing. Cross-check that all sections function correctly across different screen sizes and browsers.

---

### **How to Use the Traceability Matrix:**
- At the beginning of the project, fill out the "Status" column as "Pending" for all features.
- As development progresses, developers should update the matrix with the current status for each section.
- During final QA, the team should **verify each feature** listed in the matrix to ensure that all functionalities are working as intended.
- The matrix will help provide visibility to the project manager, designers, and developers on what has been completed and what is still pending.

This matrix helps ensure a structured and methodical approach to implementing all the required features of the POS system frontend.
